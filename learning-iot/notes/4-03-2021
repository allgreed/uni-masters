notes:
- 1:12:00 => why would we want JIT?
    - code size
        - isn't this better addressed as a proper compression?
    - higher level features
        - is this really such a good idea?
    - not really that usefull
- the lecture around ~30:00 mentions seonsor readings / radio transmitions being more energetically draining than computation
    - I know it's a general statement, but wondering if there is some quantitative reading I can dabble into
    - asking for Tanenbaum equivalent about this
- rule of thumb 1 bit of transmission => 1k bits of computation
- Neuralink -> Personal Area Networks
- some similarities to big data => because the links and processors are scaled down proportionally
