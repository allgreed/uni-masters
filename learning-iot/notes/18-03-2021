- does the microcontrollers have fancy microarchitecture?
    - they're very simple
    - variable length cycles => this is how certain register bit access can be faster
- how does it work that registers are stored in memory layout?
    - nope nope nope
        - different type of memory, but works as on the single bus
        - datasheet <- veryf
    - no need to implement physical registers, CPU is too slow, just hardcode the access for a few memory regions and you're golden
- gdb equivalents? o.0
    - you can buy a debugger
    - I've seen some emulators -> back in the day they weren't that great
- what zeroed R1 is used for?
    - very internals
    - can be reversed using AI
- are humans able to write better assembly than a compiler [given the constraints]?
    - when working on low-level optimization, maaaaybe
- are we going to cover interrupt routines?
    - yup :D
