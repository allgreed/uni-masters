Tradeoffs:
- marginally easier to implement
- marginally easier to troubleshoot (json is human readable-ish)
- potentially larger [de]serialization overhead => "parsing" via offsets + struct unpacking is probably much faster
- larger payload size => pure binary protocol would allow much more compression
- may lead to problems with hash verification when using seperate protcol and interanl objects
