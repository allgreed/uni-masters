- the total number of users is limited to 9025 ( + ~ same amount for "shadow accounts" for mines)
- WBE is not divisible
- there is no caching, the state has to be recomputed every time from the list of all transactions
- there is no persistency, if a node goes out for whatever reason [including update] it has to redownload every transaction
- consensus is not bizantyne tolerant - malicious node could easily corrupt the state by spreading false data
- consensus cannot be achieved if transactions are issued in the same nanosecond
- double spending is not verified on the receiving node
- there is no way of knowing who if the transaction issuance was authorized
- don't see problems with the execution engine tbh
- history of transactions can be easily rewritten by malicious actor having access to the network for a short time
- protocol is very chatty (sometimes it took 30-40 messages to reach consensus in a network of 3 nodes)
- messages are broadcasted [which affects network congestion]
- there is no way of handling dropped or delayed messages
