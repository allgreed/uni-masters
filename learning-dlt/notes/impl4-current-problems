- doesn't work with more than 1 node
- collisions may be a problem?
- internal types not properly constrained
- private key generated on every node startup (security concern)
- special case for quarry account
- UI IoC could be more expressive I guess
- miner would be anoying to resync

not-solved:
    - WBE is not divisible

could-be-solved:
    - there is no caching, the state has to be recomputed every time from the list of all transactions
    - there is no persistency, if a node goes out for whatever reason [including update] it has to redownload every transaction
    - there is no way of knowing who if the transaction issuance was authorized
    - history of transactions can be easily rewritten by malicious actor having access to the network for a short time

===

solved:
    - the total number of users is limited to 9025 ( + ~ same amount for "shadow accounts" for mines)

not-applicable-yet:
    - consensus is not bizantyne tolerant - malicious node could easily corrupt the state by spreading false data
    - consensus cannot be achieved if transactions are issued in the same nanosecond
    - double spending is not verified on the receiving node
    - protocol is very chatty (sometimes it took 30-40 messages to reach consensus in a network of 3 nodes)
    - messages are broadcasted [which affects network congestion]
    - there is no way of handling dropped or delayed messages
