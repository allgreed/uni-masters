Storage, only storing events / diffs / bits,
    because the state is mutable (balances can change), but the events / bits / transaction cannot and the immutability solves a wide range of problems

10:36 -> who should be "transactionFrom"? -> just use some random numbers


- for the future => maybe just give people protobufs? xD
    - that was by design

- is every message broadcasted?
    yes

- bootstrap paradox?
    - nope 
- also: how do I know that the node has received all sync messages?
    - just count them? xD
    - distinguishable messages?
    So... the sync is non-blocking, but has a wait

- how to reasonably code this? globals everywhere? :C not really
- ok => adding to the ledger, dropping => nok
- state machine <- not really needed
